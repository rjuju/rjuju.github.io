My name is Julien Rouhaud.  I've been a PostgreSQL developer and DBA for more
than a decade.  I'm also recognized as a [PostgreSQL major
contributor](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/).

I try to contribute to open source projects as much as I can. I'm mainly
involved in:

* [HypoPG](http://github.com/hypopg/hypopg), an extension to add hypothetical
  indexes in PostgreSQL
* [PoWA](http://github.com/powa-team), a PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer
* [check_pgactivity](http://github.com/opmdg/check_pgactivity), a dedicated
  Nagios monitoring agent for PostgreSQL
* and of course [PostgreSQL itself](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/postgresql.git/?p=postgresql.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=rouhaud).
