My name is Julien Rouhaud, I'm a DBA at [Dalibo](http://www.dalibo.com), a french company providing support on [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).

I try to contribute on open source projects as much as I can. I'm mainly involved in

* [PoWA](http://dalibo.github.io/powa), a PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer
* [OPM](http://opm.github.io), a dedicated monitoring suite for PostgreSQL
