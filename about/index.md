My name is Julien Rouhaud.  I've been a PostgreSQL DBA and software developer
for  multiple years.

I try to contribute on open source projects as much as I can. I'm mainly
involved in:

* [HypoPG](http://github.com/hypopg/hypopg), an extension to add hypothetical
  indexes in PostgreSQL
* [PoWA](http://github.om/powa-team), a PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer
* [OPM](http://opm.github.io), a dedicated monitoring suite for PostgreSQL
* and of course PostgreSQL itself.
