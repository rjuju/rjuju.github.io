Last month, I had the chance to talk about PostgreSQL monitoring, and present
some of the tools I'm working on at [pgconf.ru](http://en.pgconf.ru/).

This talk was a good opportunity to work on an overview of existing projects
dealing with monitoring or performance, see what may be lacking and what can be
done to change this situation.

Here are my slides:

If you're interested in this topic, or if you developped a tool I missed while
writing these slides (my apologies if it's the case),
[the official wiki page](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Monitoring)
is the place you should go first.

I'd also like to thank all the [pgconf.ru](http://en.pgconf.ru/) staff for their
work, this conference was a big success, and [the biggest postgresql-centric event
ever organized](https://twitter.com/DenishPatel/status/563710192672849920).
